-------------------------MEMORIA------------------------

Project Details : Memoria is a software which enables the user to keep a private journal. User can pick
his/her mood and activities he/she has been doing during the day. You can also keep notes like an old traditional
diary. You can also set goals and motivate yourself to achieve them as you can monitor them. Memoria collects
recorded mood, activities, goals and notes in a private database. Which helps to created various statistics such
as graphs and charts. Our main goal is to make everyone productive by letting them know what they have been

doing and what they should be doing in order to achieve their goals and to keep a good mood.
